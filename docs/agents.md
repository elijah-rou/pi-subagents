# Agents

Upgrading from the fork before v0.59? Review [global-instruction, read-only-role, and external-profile migration](migration-v059.md).

An agent is a markdown file: YAML frontmatter on top, a system prompt below. The frontmatter defines the specialist that runs in the child Pi process.

```yaml

name: scout

## Where agents live

Lowest to highest priority:

| Scope | Path |
|-------|------|
| Builtin | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/agents/` |
| Installed package | `package.json` `pi-subagents.agents` or `pi.subagents.agents` |
| User | `~/.pi/agent/agents/**/*.md` |
| Project | Project config `agents/**/*.md` (`.pi/agents/**/*.md` in standard Pi) |

Discovery notes:

- Project discovery also reads legacy `.agents/**/*.md` files. If both `.agents/` and the project config agents directory define the same parsed runtime agent name, the project config directory wins.
- Nested subdirectories are discovered recursively. `.chain.md` files do not define agents.
- Installed Pi packages can expose agent directories from either `{"pi-subagents":{"agents":["./agents"]}}` or `{"pi":{"subagents":{"agents":["./agents"]}}}` in their package manifest. Package agents load above builtins and below user/project agents.
- Use `agentScope: "user" | "project" | "both"` to control discovery. `both` is the default, and project definitions win runtime-name collisions.

## Builtin agents

Builtins load at the lowest priority, so a user or project agent with the same name overrides them. They do not pin a provider model; they inherit your current Pi default model unless you set `subagents.defaultModel` or `subagents.agentOverrides.<name>.model` (see [models.md](models.md)).

| Agent | Use it when you want... |
|-------|--------------------------|
| `scout` | Fast local codebase recon: relevant files, entry points, data flow, risks, and where another agent should start. |
| `researcher` | Web/docs research with sources: official docs, specs, benchmarks, recent changes, and a concise research brief. |
| `worker` | Implementation work, including approved oracle handoffs. It edits files, validates, and escalates unapproved decisions instead of guessing. |
| `reviewer` | Code review and small fixes. It checks the implementation against the task/plan, tests, edge cases, and simplicity. |
| `oracle` | A second opinion before acting. It challenges assumptions, catches drift, and recommends the safest next move without editing. |
| `delegate` | A lightweight general delegate when you want a child agent that behaves close to the parent session. |

Rule of thumb: `scout` before you understand the code, `researcher` before you trust external facts, `worker` to implement, `reviewer` to check, and `oracle` when the decision itself feels risky.

`oracle` is an advisory reviewer that critiques direction and proposes an execution prompt without editing files. `advisor` is the same bundled role under the Claude Code-compatible name.

### Optional Surf integration

When `surf-cli` is installed and loaded, Surf can expose a `gpt-pro` package agent through the `surf-oracle` external-job provider. It starts through the same `subagent({ agent: "gpt-pro" })` mental model as any other agent, but Surf owns the package agent and provider. Surf maps `model: pro` to ChatGPT GPT-5.6 Sol Pro web mode. pi-subagents does not own that model mapping.

If you disabled the old bundled `gpt-pro` workaround with `agentOverrides.gpt-pro.disabled`, remove that override before using Surf's package agent.

The Pi async run remains the source of truth for status, artifacts, wake/wait, retention, and diagnostics. Package 2a does not attach new mission records.

### External CLI runner data boundary

External CLI profiles are not bundled or listed by default. Define one explicitly in your user or project agent directory, or install a package that exposes it through `pi-subagents.agents`. Discovery and `subagent({ action: "list" })` parse profile metadata only; they do not execute the CLI, probe authentication, or check workspace trust. Launch preflight performs adapter-specific version and help checks.

External CLI agents use their own fail-closed capability contract. Do not pass native Pi child options such as model override, structured output, acceptance/agent contract, tool budgets, fast mode, fork context, skills, or native Pi tools unless the adapter implements them. Runs are one-shot and non-resumable. Status and receipts report the selected adapter, unsupported capabilities, and non-resumability reason; code-owned adapters also report their effective access and safety metadata.

The code-owned Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor adapters remain supported. Their argv and safety constraints cannot be widened from profile frontmatter. The read-only adapter identities are reserved: settings, aliases, package-local names, runtime registration, and management actions cannot map them to writer adapters. Writer access requires selecting the distinct writer identity explicitly. All examples require the corresponding local CLI to be installed and authenticated; Claude Code also requires operator trust in user settings/hooks, and Cursor requires operator-managed workspace trust.

Copy a definition below into a separate `.md` file. Read-only and writer examples are intentionally separate.

#### Writer adapter examples

Writer profiles opt into mutation only through their explicit writer adapter identity. Confirm local CLI authentication and trust requirements before selecting one.

**Codex writer**

```

Codex uses a bounded final-message artifact. Claude Code and Cursor require one successful terminal result with non-empty final text. Malformed, oversized, duplicate, failed, or incomplete protocol output fails closed. Cursor prompt handoffs use a private temporary file that is removed after terminal completion. Adapter-specific smoke tests remain opt-in maintainer checks; they are not discovery probes.

### External-job state table

| Durable file | Owner | States | Release predicate | Rollback predicate | Stale-head behavior | Fail-closed cases |
|--------------|-------|--------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| `status.json` step `runner` and `externalJob` | pi-subagents async runner | `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `stopped`, `blocked` | Provider `result` returns terminal data and the async result is written | Provider start/follow-up/status/result/reattach returns an error | If a status file already has a provider job id, recovery calls `reattach` and `result`; it refuses to start a new prompt when the provider, prompt digest, parent job id, request id, request digest, or options differ | Missing provider, unsupported follow-up provider, capacity conflict, malformed provider response, bridge timeout, prompt digest mismatch, parent conversation missing |
| `result.json` or session result payload | pi-subagents async runner | `complete`, `failed`, `stopped` | All steps reach terminal state and result publication succeeds or is recoverably indexed | Result write fails and pending result repair records the terminal state | Stale status can repair from an existing result file | Unindexed sessionless stale failure |
| `external-job-requests/` and `external-job-responses/` | Host-mediated provider bridge | pending request, terminal response | Host process writes a matching response and removes the request | Bridge timeout or malformed request response | Requests are operation-scoped. Recovery sends `reattach`/`result`, not `start` or `follow-up`, when job metadata exists. `start` and `follow-up` use durable dispatch claims | Provider not registered, host bridge not loaded, malformed request, provider exception, ambiguous dispatch without a provider job id |
| Provider artifact path | External provider | provider-defined terminal artifact | Provider returns `artifactPath`, or Pi writes returned text to `external-job-<index>.result.md` | Provider reports failure or no result | Existing artifact path is retained in `status.json` | Missing artifact with no text output returns a terminal message instead of inventing content |

The `researcher` builtin uses `web_search`, `fetch_content`, and `get_search_content`. Those require [pi-web-access](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-web-access):

```bash
pi install npm:pi-web-access
```

## Overriding builtins

You can override selected builtin fields without copying the whole agent. Overrides live in settings:

- User: `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`
- Project: project config settings file (`.pi/settings.json` in standard Pi)

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "agentOverrides": {
      "reviewer": {
        "description": "Independent review tier",
        "inheritProjectContext": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Supported override fields: `description`, `output`, `outputMode`, `defaultReads`, `model`, `defaultProvider`, `fallbackModels`, `thinking`, `systemPromptMode`, `inheritProjectContext`, `inheritGlobalContext`, `inheritSkills`, `defaultContext`, `acceptanceRole`, `disabled`, `skills`, `tools`, and `systemPrompt`.

- `description` replaces the discovered description for builtin and custom agents, which lets list output show deployment-specific routing or model metadata.
- Use `output: false`, `defaultReads: false`, `defaultContext: false`, or `acceptanceRole: false` to clear an inherited value.
- Use `tools: "inherit"` on a builtin when that one role should omit its bundled tool allowlist and receive Pi's normal builtins and ambient extensions. This keeps strict tools as the default for other builtins.
- Project overrides beat user overrides.
- Matching user and project agents also receive override fields that their frontmatter leaves unset, so a shared project config agent can keep the persona while local settings choose the model.

Disable, restore, eject, create, update, and delete agent definitions through the human `/subagents` interface. `disabled: true` hides a builtin from runtime discovery and model-facing `subagent({ action: "list" })` output, while `subagents.disableBuiltins: true` disables all builtins at once. The `/subagents` interface selects user or project scope explicitly; project overrides still win over user overrides.

## Prompt assembly

Subagents are narrow by default. Custom agents start with a clean system prompt and only the context you intentionally give them. They do not automatically inherit Pi's whole base prompt, project instruction files, or discovered skills catalog.

Use these fields when an agent should see more:

| Field | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `systemPromptMode: append` | Append the agent prompt to Pi's normal base prompt. |
| `inheritProjectContext: true` | Keep inherited repository instructions from files like `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. |
| `inheritGlobalContext: false` | Explicitly remove operator-global instruction files from the Pi config agent directory (such as `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`) for token savings or isolation. When omitted, it follows the resolved `inheritProjectContext` value. |
| `inheritSkills: true` | Let the child see Pi's discovered skills catalog. |
| `defaultContext: fork` | Prefer forked session context when a launch omits `context`; if the parent has no persisted session file or current leaf yet, the implicit default falls back to `fresh` without a failed first attempt. Explicit `context: "fork"` remains strict, and explicit `context: "fresh"` still wins. |

Builtin agents opt into repository instruction inheritance by default so they follow repo-specific rules out of the box. Because omitted `inheritGlobalContext` follows the resolved project-context setting, they also retain authoritative operator-global instructions. Set `inheritGlobalContext: false` explicitly when the token savings or isolation outweigh that inherited policy. `delegate` also uses append mode because its job is orchestration inside the parent workflow.

```

Simple-scalar list fields accept either a comma-separated form or a newline block list with one `- item` per line. This applies to `tools`, `defaultReads`, `skill`/`skills`, `skillPath`, `fallbackModels`, `extensions`, and `subagentOnlyExtensions`:

```yaml
tools:
  - read
  - mcp:github/search_repositories
fallbackModels:
  - openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna:low
  - anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
```

Field notes:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `package` | Optional package identifier. A file with `name: scout` and `package: code-analysis` registers as `code-analysis.scout`; serialization keeps `name` and `package` separate. |
| `aliases` | Optional comma-separated or block-list names that resolve to this agent for selection and explicit `agent` and task inputs. Runtime status, persistence, and config still use the canonical `name`. Exact canonical names take precedence over aliases, and alias collisions between distinct canonical agents fail as ambiguous. |
| `tools` | Strict child tool allowlist. Named extension tools must also have their provider loaded. `mcp:` entries select direct MCP tools when `pi-mcp-adapter` is installed. |
| `allowNestedSubagents` | Set `true` to authorize the child-safe nested `subagent` runtime without making omitted `tools` an allowlist. Inherited depth and capability ceilings remain authoritative. |
| `extensions` | Omitted means normal extensions; empty means no extensions; list values allowlist specific extensions. |
| `subagentOnlyExtensions` | Extension paths loaded only in spawned child sessions for this agent. Tools registered there are unavailable to the main agent unless also installed through normal Pi extension configuration. |
| `model` | Default model. Bare ids prefer the current provider when possible, then unique registry matches. |
| `fallbackModels` | Ordered backup models for provider/model failures such as quota, auth, timeout, or unavailable model. Ordinary task failures do not trigger fallback. |
| `thinking` | Appended as a `:level` suffix at runtime unless a suffix is already present. |
| `systemPromptMode` | `replace` by default; `append` keeps Pi's base prompt. |
| `inheritProjectContext` | Keeps or strips inherited repository instruction blocks. |
| `inheritGlobalContext` | Keeps or strips operator-global instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`) from the Pi config agent directory. When omitted, it resolves to the already-resolved `inheritProjectContext` value; explicit `false` remains authoritative. It has an effect only when project context is enabled, because `inheritProjectContext: false` removes all inherited context. |
| `inheritSkills` | Keeps or strips Pi's discovered skills catalog. |
| `defaultContext` | Optional `fresh` or `fork` launch-context preference. An implicit `fork` falls back to `fresh` when the parent has no persisted session file or current leaf; an explicit launch `context: "fork"` remains strict. |
| `skills` | Selects specific skills for the child, regardless of `inheritSkills`. |
| `skillPath` | Invocation-private skill files or discovery directories. Relative paths resolve from the agent definition file. Local matches take precedence, while unresolved or unreadable matches fall back to normal skill discovery. This field discovers candidates only; `skills` still selects what the child receives. |
| `output` | Default single-agent output file. |
| `defaultReads` | Files to read before running the agent. |
| `defaultProgress` | Maintain `progress.md`. |
| `async` | Default a single-agent launch to background (`true`) or foreground (`false`) when the call omits `async`. Explicit call values and `forceTopLevelAsync` win. |
| `timeoutMs` | Positive integer default runtime deadline in milliseconds for single-agent launches. Foreground launches use 30 minutes when neither the call nor agent provides a timeout; explicit `timeoutMs`/`maxRuntimeMs` and agent defaults win. |
| `toolTimeoutMs` | Optional positive integer hard per-tool-call deadline in milliseconds. An explicit call value wins, then this agent default, global `toolTimeoutMs`, and `PI_SUBAGENT_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS`. When omitted, known-fast built-in tools get a five-minute default; long-running tools get attention notices but no hard default. It does not extend the run-level deadline; `contact_supervisor`, `intercom`, and `subagent_wait` are exempt. |
| `acceptance` | Acceptance default for single-agent launches. Use a scalar level such as `checked` or an inline/block YAML map such as `{ level: "none", reason: "lightweight lookup" }`. Explicit call values win; `workflowScript` acceptance remains workflow-default or child-item configuration. |
| `acceptanceRole` | Optional `read-only` or `writer` role for automatic acceptance inference. Explicit task mutation or no-edit intent wins; otherwise the declared role replaces agent-name guessing. This does not grant or revoke tools. |
| `mutationTools` | Comma-separated extension tool names whose calls count as mutation attempts for the completion guard. This declares evidence only; list and load each tool through `tools` and its extension provider as usual. |
| `completionGuard` | Set `false` only for non-implementation agents that may mention implementation words while using mutation-capable tools such as `bash`. |
| `interactive` | Parsed for compatibility but not currently enforced. |
| `maxSubagentDepth` | Tightens nested delegation for this agent's children. |
| `memory` | Opt-in role-specific persistent memory. See below. |

## Per-agent persistent memory

A recurring custom agent can opt into a durable, role-specific memory scope with the `memory` frontmatter field:

```yaml
memory:
  scope: project
  path: security-reviewer
```

This is independent of Pi's own parent/session/project memory system and writes nothing to it. Memory lives under a dedicated `agent-memory/` namespace so the two never collide.

How it works:

- On each run, the first 200 lines of `MEMORY.md` in the resolved memory directory are injected into the child system prompt, so the agent can recall accumulated role notes such as threat-model entries, release gotchas, or verified commands.
- Agents with write tools (`edit`, `write`, or `bash`, or no `tools` allowlist at all) are told they may append concise dated entries to the file.
- Agents without write tools receive a read-only memory block and are not instructed to edit it. A read-only reviewer can recall prior notes without gaining write capability.
- The memory directory is never created eagerly. The agent's own `write` tool creates it (and `MEMORY.md`) on the first persist.
- Memory paths are validated against `.`/`..` traversal and symlink escape. An unsafe or unresolvable scope is silently skipped rather than breaking the run.

Scopes:

- Project: resolves under `<project>/.pi/agent-memory/<path>` and travels with the repo.
- User: resolves under `~/.pi/agent/agent-memory/<path>` and is shared across projects for that agent.

## Refinement overlays

A refinement overlay is bounded, project-local guidance layered on top of one agent's system prompt without editing the agent file. Use it when an agent repeatedly stumbles on the same project-specific issue and recent run evidence shows what to correct.

Use the human interface:

```text
/subagents-refine reviewer
```

How it works:

- `refine` collects bounded evidence from that agent's recent runs in the project (statuses, errors, review findings, residual risks, output tails), ranks acceptance failures and structured findings ahead of ordinary output context, then launches a fresh read-only proposal child to draft small guidance edits. Candidate collection is bounded per source, the final packet has at most 8 items/16 KiB, and each complete serialized item is capped at 2 KiB.
- Proposed guidance is validated before it is written. Edits that try to override safety, policy, tool, output, acceptance, developer, or system instructions are rejected, as are edits that target all agents or base agent files.
- The accepted overlay is stored at `.pi/subagents/refinements/<agent>.md` with revision metadata and snapshots. Each `refine` or `refine.rollback` adds a snapshot, and `refine.rollback` restores the previous revision.
- At launch, the current overlay is injected into that agent's child system prompt as a `<pi-subagents-refinement>` block scoped to this project. The base agent definition is never modified.

The human refinement interface shows the current overlay and revision history and supports its existing rollback flow. Delete the overlay file to remove the refinement entirely.

## Tool and extension selection

How `tools` behaves:

- `tools` omitted: `pi-subagents` does not pass `--tools`, so the child gets Pi's normal builtin tools.
- `tools` present: regular tool names become an explicit allowlist.
- `tools:` empty: emits `--no-tools`.
- `allowNestedSubagents: true`: explicitly enables child-safe nested fanout without turning omitted `tools` into an allowlist. Depth and inherited capability ceilings still apply.

An allowlisted name does not load the extension that registers it. Load that provider through normal Pi extension discovery, `extensions`, `subagentOnlyExtensions`, or a path-like `tools` entry.

More rules:

- `mcp:` entries are split out and forwarded as direct MCP selections without granting normal builtins unless those builtins are also listed.
- Path-like `tools` entries, such as extension paths or `.ts`/`.js` files, are treated as tool-extension paths rather than tool names.
- Internal runtime tools such as `structured_output` are added to an explicit allowlist only when their contract is active.
- Unknown extension tool calls count as mutation attempts only when their names are listed in `mutationTools`; undeclared unknown tools keep the no-edit guard active.
- Agents that declare only known read-only builtin tools skip the implementation completion guard. `bash`, unknown tools, and MCP tools stay mutation-capable. Use `completionGuard: false` for bash-enabled validators or advisors that should never be judged as implementation agents.

Examples:

- `tools` omitted and `extensions` omitted: normal builtins and normal extensions.
- `tools: mcp:chrome-devtools`: only the resolved direct Chrome DevTools MCP tools.
- `tools: read, bash, mcp:chrome-devtools`: only `read` and `bash` as builtins, plus direct Chrome DevTools MCP tools.
- `tools: subagent, read`: a child-safe `subagent` tool is available inside that child so it can run explicitly assigned nested fanout.
- `allowNestedSubagents: true` with `tools` omitted: normal builtin tools and ambient extensions remain inherited, and the child-safe nested `subagent` runtime is added.
- `tools: read, fixture_search` plus `subagentOnlyExtensions: ./tools/fixture-search.ts`: the provider loads only in this agent's child process, and the registered `fixture_search` name survives the strict allowlist.

Direct MCP tools require [pi-mcp-adapter](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mcp-adapter). Subagents only receive direct MCP tools when `mcp:` entries are listed in their frontmatter; global `directTools: true` in `mcp.json` is not enough by itself. The generic `mcp` proxy tool can still be used for discovery when available. The adapter caches tool metadata at startup, so after connecting a new MCP server for the first time, restart Pi before relying on direct tools. Server `includeTools` and `excludeTools` policies are enforced while resolving cached metadata for children: both accept exact names and `*`/`?` glob patterns against raw, generated-resource, and server/short/none-prefixed names, with `excludeTools` taking precedence. An `mcp:` entry named `subagent` does not authorize nested fanout; declare the builtin `subagent` tool or set `allowNestedSubagents: true`. If a resolved direct MCP name is missing from the child registry, pi-subagents keeps the launch failed under the strict allowlist and identifies the condition as a host/pi-mcp-adapter registration problem; verify that the adapter registers the selected tools before child startup.

`extensions` controls child extension loading:

```yaml
# Omitted: all normal extensions load

# Empty: no extensions
extensions:

# Allowlist
extensions: /abs/path/to/ext-a.ts, /abs/path/to/ext-b.ts
```

When `extensions` is present, normal discovered extensions are disabled. The listed extensions, path-like `tools` entries, required pi-subagents runtime extensions, and `subagentOnlyExtensions` still load.

Use `subagentOnlyExtensions` when a custom extension tool should exist only inside child sessions. It is scoped by agent config: every run of that agent receives those extension paths, while other agents do not unless they declare the same field. The current model does not have a separate named-subagent audience inside one agent definition.

To apply the same `extensions` allowlist to every agent that does not declare its own, set `subagents.defaultExtensions` in user or project settings (see [configuration.md](configuration.md)).

Before the first model turn, the child runtime compares every explicit tool name with Pi's final filtered registry. A missing provider fails the run with the unavailable names and concrete `subagentOnlyExtensions`/`extensions` guidance, instead of letting a direct or chained child silently continue without its requested tools.

## Skills

Skills are `SKILL.md` files made available to an agent. The prompt includes skill metadata and the file location; the agent reads the full skill file only when the task matches.

Discovery uses project-first precedence:

1. Project config `skills/{name}/SKILL.md` (`.pi/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` in standard Pi)
2. Project packages and project settings packages via `package.json -> pi.skills`
3. Current task cwd package via `package.json -> pi.skills`
4. Project config `settings.json -> skills`
5. `~/.pi/agent/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
6. User packages and user settings packages via `package.json -> pi.skills`
7. `~/.pi/agent/settings.json -> skills`

Use agent defaults, override them at runtime, or disable them:

```ts
{ workflowScript: `return runs.run("main", { agent: "scout", task: "..." })` }
{ workflowScript: `return runs.run("main", { agent: "scout", task: "...", skill: "tmux, safe-bash" })` }
{ workflowScript: `return runs.run("main", { agent: "scout", task: "...", skill: false })` }
```

For chains, `skill` at the top level is additive. A step-level `skill` overrides that step; `false` disables skills for that step.

Available skills use this shape in the child prompt:

```xml
The following configured skills are available to this subagent.
Use the read tool to load a skill's file when the task matches its description.
When a skill file references a relative path, resolve it against the skill directory (parent of SKILL.md / dirname of the path) and use that absolute path in tool commands.

<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>safe-bash</name>
    <description>Run shell commands safely.</description>
    <location>/absolute/path/to/safe-bash/SKILL.md</location>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
```

If an agent has an explicit `tools` allowlist and resolved skills, `read` is added for that child run so the listed skill files can be loaded on demand.

Missing skills do not fail execution. The result summary shows a warning.

Agent-local `skillPath` candidates never enter Pi's parent/global skills catalog. Pair `inheritSkills: false` with explicit `skills` and `skillPath` when a child should receive only its selected private skills.

## The bundled pi-subagents skill

The package bundles a `pi-subagents` skill that is automatically available to the parent agent when the extension is installed. It is for the orchestrating parent only: child subagents never receive it, and their context is explicitly filtered to strip parent-only orchestration instructions.

What it covers:

- **Delegation patterns**: when to launch which agent, whether to use a direct child or `workflowScript`, whether to run asynchronously, and whether to use fresh, forked, or profile context.
- **Prompt workflow recipes**: how to apply the packaged techniques directly with `subagent(...)` when the user describes the workflow in natural language instead of invoking a slash command. This includes parallel review, review-loop, parallel research, parallel context-build, parallel handoff-plan, gather-context-and-clarify, and parallel cleanup.
- **Role-agent prompting guidance**: compact contract prompts instead of long scripts, what to include in role-specific meta prompts, and retrieval budgets for researchers.
- **Safety boundaries**: child agents must not run subagents unless their resolved builtin tools explicitly include `subagent`, must not invent intercom targets, and must escalate unapproved decisions.
- **Intercom conventions**: when to ask vs send, and how parent-side supervisor/result delivery works through the native channel.
- **Control and diagnostics**: attention signals, soft interrupts, status, and the `doctor` action.

If you are writing an agent that orchestrates subagents, the bundled skill helps it behave correctly without guessing the patterns. If you are a human user, you do not need to read it; the README and prompt shortcuts encode the same workflows in user-facing form.
